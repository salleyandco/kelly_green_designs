Romantic, elegant and timeless and rich in family tradition was the vision for an intimate wedding at the historical Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington, DC. The bride knew exactly what she wanted down to the very personal detail of having the Bible that had been a part of generations of family weddings attached to her bouquet.

The floral focal for the ceremony was a full-sized Chuppah, densely layered with fresh salal leaves and accented with Israeli and Italian ruscus. Soft clustering of 500 traditional white and spray roses completed the design and complemented the Bride’s all-rose bouquet.

The show-stopping King’s table was the highlight of the reception dinner. Vase collections of like flowers were nestled together to create a ribbon of flowers and candlelight down the center of the table. The flower selection was curated to capture the memories of family members. Peonies, ranunculus, freesia, roses, orchids and stock flowers densely grouped made for an elegant, yet dramatic presentation.

Every step of the design process is personal and intentional.
