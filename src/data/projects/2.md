When your 9–5 entails designing events for the First Lady of the United States, curating your own DIY wedding becomes a deeply personal extension of the work you love.Our collaboration to support the floral vision was just one part of the bride’s plan, which included the finest details from creating hand-dyed ombre napkins, addressing the invites, making river rock name cards, and painted signs.

Her fiancé, a woodworking enthusiast, built the trunk for their ceremony altar, signs, and table numbers. And together, they made succulent terrariums and orchid centerpieces for their reception tables as well as homemade soap as a wedding favor. The details of their DIY wedding projects can be found in the Style Me Pretty feature Elegant DIY Wedding at Belle Haven On The James.

Since they already knew exactly how to set the mood for their non-traditional wedding day, Kelly Green Designs stepped in to complete the vision with bespoke, personal flowers.

Pairing astilbe wildflowers and trailing jasmine vine with aromatic David Austin garden roses created the framework of our look. Adding distinctive accents like silver brunia berry sprays to cover the stems of groom’s boutonnière was the sophisticated touch of modern artistry meeting the airy softness of organic design.
